          He is considered as one of the greatest footballers of all time, an
          icon, a legend. Lionel Andres Messi was born 24 june 1987, is an
          Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for ligue 1
          giants Paris Saint-Germain and captains the Argentina national team.
          Messi was born and raised in central Argentina, Messi relocated to
          Spain to join Barcelona at the age of 13, for whom he made his
          competitve debut at age of 17 in october 2004.

          He established himself as an integral player for the club within the
          next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in 2008-09 he
          helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football; that
          year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon d'or. Three successful
          seasons followed, with Messi winning four consecutive Ballons d'Or,
          making him the first player to win the award four times and in a
          row.[10] During the 2011-12 season, he set the La Liga and European
          records for most goals scored in a single season, while establishing
          himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The following two seasons,
          Messi finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo
          (his perceived career rival), before regaining his best form during
          the 2014-15 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and
          leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which he was
          awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of
          Barcelona in 2018, and in 2019 he won a record sixth Ballon d'Or. Out
          of contract, he signed for Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021.

          An Argentine international, Messi holds the national record for
          appearances and is also the country's all-time leading goalscorer. At
          youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship, finishing
          the tournament with both the Golden Ball and Golden Shoe, and an
          Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. His style of play as a
          diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with his compatriot
          Diego Maradona, who described Messi as his successor. After his senior
          debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and
          score in a FIFA World Cup in 2006, and reached the final of the 2007
          Copa América, where he was named young player of the tournament. As
          the squad's captain from August 2011, he led Argentina to three
          consecutive finals: the 2014 FIFA World Cup, for which he won the
          Golden Ball, and the 2015 and 2016 Copa América, winning the Golden
          Ball in the 2015 edition. After announcing his international
          retirement in 2016, he reversed his decision and led his country to
          qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a third-place finish at the
          2019 Copa América, and won the 2021 Copa América, while winning the
          Golden Ball and Golden Boot award for the latter. This achievement
          would see him receive a record seventh Ballon d'Or in 2021
        </p>

          Messi has endorsed sportswear company Adidas since 2006. According to
          France Football, he was the world's highest-paid footballer for five
          years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked the world's
          highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2019 and 2022.[11] Messi was among
          Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2011 and 2012. In
          February 2020, he was awarded the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year,
          thus becoming the first footballer and the first team sport athlete to
          win the award. Later that year, Messi became the second footballer
          (and second team-sport athlete) to surpass $1 billion in career
          earnings.
